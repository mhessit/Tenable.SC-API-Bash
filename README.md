# Tenable.SC-API-Bash
This is something I have been working on strictly because I can't use https://github.com/tenable/pyTenable (pyTenable) in my enviroment.
I would highly reccomend you investigate this option first before going with my scripts, as pyTenable is far superior in terms of ability and control (also supports Tenable.IO)


Disclaimers: 
1. This is meant to run on RHEL and all the included tools RHEL has to offer running in bash shell scripts
2. A lot of these scripts are designed so I can use it with many different Tenable.SCs 
3. I am no developer by any strech, and don't claim to be
4. https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/api/index.htm is where I get most of the REST API portions of the code for the cURL reqeusts


I just wanted to share my janky way I have made working with the Tenable.SC API a little easier when limited
